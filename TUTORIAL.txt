Step 1: Setup of the WiFi module
1.Power up Arduino board. In several seconds in the list of available networks will appear new network — with the name Arduino-Uno-WiFi-****** where ****** — unique number of a board.
2.Connect to the found network and come in the browser to the address:
192.168.240.1
The web interface of setup of a board Arduino will open.
3.Come into network settings of a board, clicking the CHANGE button in the SSID Network point.
4.Select your Wi-Fi a network from the list of available networks, enter the password and connect to it.
5.In case of successful connection to Wi-Fi of a network information on the appropriated IP address will appear. Remember or write it. In our example we received the address 192.168.43.17.
6.Now on Arduino Uno WiFi it is possible to come from any device connected to this network.
Step 2:
Create your code/Create your scheme using led,resistor and wires
Upload it to Arduino using Arduino IDE
If you completed everything listed in Step 1 you can freely open your web browser on all devices connected to your home network!
Go to site (YOUR IP ADDRESS HERE)/arduino/webserver/
